# Programming Assignment 3 - PA3 (Part 2)

This programming assignment is to get us familiar with the synchronization 
constructs we discussed in class â€“ mutexes, semaphores, and monitors. There 
are two problems in this assignment: solving the producer/consumer problem 
with 1) semaphores, and 2) a custom monitor in C++.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
target machine for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

g++ compiler
C++ libraries
C++ pthread libraries

## Compilation and Cleaning

You will need to do the following to compile the program.

The program comes with a make file that is used to compile the program.

1. Run make in your terminal in root directory of the project as below

```sh
[username@localhost dir]$ make
```

This generates "part2" file and other files that you will use to run the 
program.

2. To clean the program (delete all generated files), run make clean as below

```sh
[username@localhost dir]$ make clean
```

This deletes all generated files from running make. The target files are 
described in the Makefile. You are free to make changes and break the program.

## Running the Program

This program can be run against arguments as shown below. Failure to supply the 
the correct arguments will result in unexpected output and behavior (Disclaimer :))


```sh
[username@localhost dir]$./part2 -b 1 -p 5 -c 5 -i 10
```
The above command will be interpreted as;
    -b 1 = create a buffer of size 1
    -p 5 = create 5 producer threads to insert items into the buffer
    -c 5 = create 5 consumer threads to consume items from the buffer
    -i 10 = produce and insert only 10 items into the buffer

The items to be inserted are specified inside the program.


## Paradigm Used

This solution follows the signal and wait paradigm because it was easier to implem-
ent. It was also easier to synchronize the threads when the signalling thread had to 
block and wait for the thread it just signalled to complete execution. And at each
point, the siganlling thread had already executed its code and was just waiting to 
exit the monitor or had blocked on a condition variable.

## Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge was achieving mutual exclusion in the monitor, ensuring that
no process is starved, and that no process waits forever when the required number of 
items has been reached. I also has challenges getting condition variables right.
 

## Lessons learnt

In this assignment, I learnt how to properly synchronize threads using semaphores. I
made use of the properties of semaphores to solve the producer-consumer problem. I
I also learnt that it's easy to get the synchronization wrong even with semaphores.

## Acknowledgements

Dr. Justin Bradley for his guidelines and tips during class and in provided document.

Quinn Lanik, our teaching assistant, who gave me great ideas on overcoming the earlier
mentioned challenges. Some ideas in this code are hers and were only implemented as 
well as modified to suit my implementation.

My classmates on Piazza also really helped.
